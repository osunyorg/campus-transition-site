    <p>An experimental eco-place of the transition  <br>The Transition Campus wants to make this area an eco-place promoting, by example, the ecological and social transition. Thus offering the opportunity to study the ecological conversion of a place through experience. Particular attention is paid to the overall consistency of the site with the vocation of the Transition Campus, and its registration in the territory. In order to initiate this major and profound transformation, Cooperative Workshops are set up in order to find the most suitable solutions to the specific location and project of the Campus by drawing on the most innovative expertise and experience. The field of Forges in transition will allow to experiment with concrete issues such as energy in buildings and transport, agriculture and food, registration in a bio-regional economy, social inclusion, frugal and friendly life, ethics and governance, which will be sources of learning for students and researchers during their stay at the Campus. <br>The Transition Campus joined the Oasis project of the Colibris movement in 2018, which supports the creation of places of life and resources for a more ecological and humane society.</p>  <p> A place, an experience </p>  <p> Become a volunteer  <br>Founded in 2018, the Transition Campus is an association law 1901.
