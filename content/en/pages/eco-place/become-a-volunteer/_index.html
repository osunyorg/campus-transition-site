New volunteers are preferred  Monday morning from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.  and departures are preferably on weekends. -  Free and conscious participation in lodging and shelter The cost of meals and accommodation for the association is about 12 euros per day per person. The lodging and the cover are considered by law as benefits in kind. However, the case law on volunteering in France stipulates that the act of volunteering must be carried out without consideration, i.e. without any benefit in kind. The association is therefore obliged to charge the volunteers for their lodging and shelter. However, we also know the diversity of short-term volunteer situations that are interested in the Campus. We therefore propose a  free and conscious participation without minimum  for lodging and covering.</p>  <p> Immersion in the eco-place  <br>   <br>As a volunteer, you will share the daily lives of members of the eco-location. Its purpose is to show how we can live happy sobriety and ecological transition in practice. A unique opportunity to :  <br> Experience life in the eco-location  <br> Share the daily lives of the inhabitants  <br> Trying to live in a community and understanding how a life works as a collective  <br> Inspire and discover everyday gestures to change lifestyle  <br> Mutualize and live happy sobriety to fight overconsumption  <br> Participate in activities and strengthen solidarity in Transition  <br> Initiate workshops and friendly times: improvisation theatre, ball folk, frescoes, collaborative games  <br> Meet and exchange with the audiences welcomed in training </p>  <p> Volunteer stories My name is Mathys Libeau, I am 19 years old, and I am a student in a training where I dedicate my projects to the ecological and social transition for a greater proximity to the human and non-human living. What my three weeks of volunteering on campus this summer brought me this summer is first and foremost meetings, exchanges, friendships... that will permeate my way of being, doing and living. Long live the community and the low-tech Hey! One of my contributions to the campus was the preparation of meals that I enjoyed very much, especially when you can take care of the soil and vegetables of the vegetable garden before they arrive in the kitchen. I was fascinated by how to produce the closest! Who knows, it may inspire me to maintain my garden... Thanks to my visit to Forges, I am leaving with inspiration and enthusiasm in Orléans to continue my training. I leave a lot of good memories here which, perhaps one day, will continue to be written... <br>Mathys Libeau <br>Design student - summer volunteer 2024</p>  <p> Go further </p>
