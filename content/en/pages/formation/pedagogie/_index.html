    <p>Faced with limiting practices...  <br>Faced with the scale of the environmental and social crises, education is faced with a delicate task: how to foster a real understanding of the issues at stake without discouraging or feeding a feeling of eco-anxiety? A quantitative and factual approach to these problems is certainly important, but it is not enough to give individuals and groups the power to act. That is why the Campus de la Transition uses an original teaching approach that combines theory and practice, while supporting people as closely as possible to their own experience. Our training courses are aimed at a wide range of learners: students in higher and secondary education, teachers, working professionals and/or those undergoing retraining, and anyone wishing to get involved.</p>  <p> The 4 pillars of our head-body-heart pedagogy  <br>   <br>The 4 pillars of our head-body-heart pedagogy <br>This pedagogy aims to mobilize both reason and practical ethics, as well as practical wisdom, i.e. the relationship to oneself, to others and to the world. The aim is to build a relationship with oneself, with others and with one's environment that fosters the emergence of "living and doing together".</p>  <p>Integrative and holistic pedagogy <br>Our pedagogy takes into account all the dimensions of the individual: intellect, know-how and emotions. It mobilizes symbolic reason as much as logical-mathematical intelligence.
