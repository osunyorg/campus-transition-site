    <p>A collective of over 70 teachers-researchers and students from all disciplines, as well as experts and actors from the company, to promote "Training in Environmental and Social Transition in Higher Education".</p>
  body: >-
    <p>The genesis  <br>   <br>The ecological and social transition is an unprecedented challenge for present and future generations. To preserve our planet and the living in all its forms imposes a new paradigm: a way of thinking the world and acting radically different. However, during 2019, several initiatives highlighted the inadequacy of the teachings in the Superior on subjects of ecological and social transition. By signing the petition proposed by The Shift Project, civil society expressed this conviction. For their part, many students joined the Collectif Pour un revenu écologique. In the summer of 2019, the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation (MESRI) mandated the Transition Campus to produce a White Paper on Transition Training in Higher Education. For the first time on this subject, S has set up a collective of over 70 teachers-researchers and students from all disciplines, as well as experts and actors from the company, ready to take up this challenge under the leadership of the Transition Campus. The collective "FORTES" was born to promote "Training in the Ecological and Social Transition in Higher Education". The members of the collective come from a wide variety of disciplinary fields (environment, health, life sciences, biologicals, physics; economics, law, management; philosophy, sociology, political sciences). Indeed, the "Great Transition" does not simply concern the environment or the economy, as it is customary to think, but the very heart of our representations, and therefore all areas of knowledge.</p>  <p> The collective  <br> Les coordinateurs </p>  <p>Four academic personalities coordinate the FORTES collective and its publications projects.</p>  <p> The publishing  <br>   <br>In one year of collaborative work, 13 working groups developed the muscles of a common skeleton. They give birth to the Great Transition Manual. Subsequently, 2021 marks the launch of a complementary collection of 12 Small Manuals of the Great Transition. These books focus on specific disciplines to further explore transition issues.</p>
