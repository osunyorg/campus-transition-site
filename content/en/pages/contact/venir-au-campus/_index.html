    <p>From the Paris region  <br>First step: join Montereau From Lyon station, choose :  <br> the transilian R  <br> the TER Burgundy direction Laroche-Migennes  <br> In particular:  <br> Train frequency: every hour  <br> Duration: 1 hour from Lyon station  <br> Cost: Montereau being in Seine-et-Marne in the Île-de-France region, the Navigo pass works. Otherwise, the ticket costs €2.5.  <br> These trains also pass through Melun and Fontainebleau.  <br> It is also possible to take the RER D until Melun, then the transilian R to Montereau. 2nd stage: reach the Campus from Montereau station (bike, bus, TAD, carpooling) Cycling  <br> It is the fastest way to reach the place: take 25 minutes at a normal pace to travel the 7 km and 70 m of positive elevation.  <br>  <br> On trains from Paris, spaces are dedicated to bicycles in certain cars.  <br> Our advice : Bicycles are the most environmentally friendly (after walking) and flexible (no need to depend on varying public transport times depending on the day). And also the nicest one to loosen your legs and see the scenery! By bus  <br> L e bus 3307 drop you directly at the Campus (jump of Forges).  <br> Buses 3301 (Freedom) and 3304 or 3308 (Gardeloup stop) can also be an option. They pass more frequently, but there is a 30-minute walk to the Campus. Since the "Freedom" stop, the stop works pretty well: tested and approved! From "Gardeloup", the path less passing which makes walking along the road more pleasant.  <br> Our advice : Adjust your departure train schedule to a bus schedule. In T.A.D. ("Transport On Demand")  <br> If you arrive at bus-incompatible schedules or are unable to walk 30 minutes.  <br> Take about 20 minutes.  <br> To reserve a TAD, first download TAD IDF Mobility application .  <br> Attention : you must book are TAD minimum 1 day in advance. This service does not work on Sundays.</p>
