  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>Between May and December 2024, the Campus de la Transition provided the USPN (Université Sorbonne Paris Nord) with a support course for teachers spread over 7 workshops. The aim of this action was to equip faculty to implement a TEDS module  (ecological transition for sustainable development), as advocated by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research. The themes of the workshop cycle addressed the  transition, the challenges of interdisciplinarity, and the relationship to politics . Two more practical sessions were devoted to co-construction of a prototype module via the method of pedagogical alignment. Very appreciated by the participants, with more than 60 people assiduous over the period, this accompanying course allowed  the emergence of a collective dynamic and a special emulation within the institution . A report published in the spring of 2025 details the lessons learned from this important work.</p>  <p> Authors  <br>  <br> Roxane Sansilvestri , Head of Training and Accompaniment at the Transition Campus, Doctor in Socio-Ecology.
