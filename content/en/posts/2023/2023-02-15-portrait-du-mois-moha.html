    Portrait of the month: Moha
  summary: >-
    <p><em>"B.L.S"</em>, Bio Local and Season. This is how Moha, by its full name Mohamed Bridji, presents her excellent cuisine. After twenty years of experience in all types of restoration, he decided to anchor himself at the Transition Campus.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Moha: This is an impressive life course. Born in Algeria, he lived in refugee centres in Germany from the age of 7 to 15. His family then moved to France. Currently, he is co-authoring a book in collaboration with an anthropologist from the CNRS, with whom he founded an association five years ago that strives to combine scientific knowledge, artistic expression and actions on the ground to combat all forms of exclusion. Discover his portrait through the Proust questionnaire!</p>  <p>   <br>The main feature of my character? I am speed, frank and direct. The quality I prefer in others? Honesty. What I hate above all else? Racism, contempt, injustice. My favorite occupation? The kitchen. My dream of happiness? Peace. If I were a flower, I'd be... A crocus from which saffron is produced. If I were an animal... A ram, like me. My favorite artists? Michael Jackson, Sade, Ray Charles, Sheikha Rimitti, Cheb Hasni, Georges Wassouf. My heroes in fiction? Wood Robin ... And in real life? The hundreds of thousands of activists who are mobilizing to combat inequalities, injustices, racism, oppression, environmental degradation. The reform I think the most? The Taubira Law. My motto? Only we go fast, many of us go far. I knew the Campus...  volunteer cook during the second confinement for the Meals solidaires du 20 e in Paris (up to 160 vegetarian meals per day for 5 months). It was this experience that brought me to the Campus. What I'm looking for at campus is... making me useful in a collective activist, helping to change the world. I like my role as a cook: it is to make the stay pleasant for all those who reside in or who are passing by. What surprised me most at Campus was...  beautiful human beings you can meet there. What the Campus brought me was...  I learned a lot professionally. I appreciate meeting new people every day. The gift of nature I want to have? The ability to feed the world. My favorite poets? Loved Césaire.</p>
