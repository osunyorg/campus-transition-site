    Support for higher education institutions to transform training Focus on partnership with CY University
  summary: >-
    <p>Since 2020, the Campus de la Transition has accompanied CY Cergy Paris Université (CYU) in an ambitious approach to the transformation of its training and pedagogy. The goal? Support teaching and leadership teams in integrating environmental and social issues into university student training. The month of December 2022 gave us the opportunity to take stock of the work done with the teaching teams, in particular that of the Humanities and Design division of CY Tech.</p>

    <p>The ambition of a broad partnership  <br>Training students on the challenges of the ecological and social transition in a systemic and sustainable way involves training and accompanying the leadership and teaching teams of higher education institutions. This is now shared by all stakeholders in the sector. It was also recalled in the Jouzel report to the Minister in 2022. This is precisely the meaning of the partnership launched in 2020 between the Transition Campus and CYU. A multi-disciplinary university with 30,000 students, 3,000 teachers and more than 250 training courses, CYU called on the Transition Campus for a multi-year partnership to develop its training. This alliance is structured around 3 axes: (1) to accompany the management of the establishment in its transformation project; (2) to train the teaching teams (teachers, and pedagogical engineers) in the ecological and social transition and to accompany them in the transformation of their training; (3) to train all CYU staff in the ecological and social transition. An approach structural and pioneering in the French academic landscape Since no other university has yet undertaken such a large project, with external partners. The innovative nature of this project is therefore a challenge. It was with the teaching team of the Humanities and Design division of CY Tech (the university's "engineering" sector) that the Transition Campus tested various forms of support and training. For the past two years, the support of this teaching team has thus served as a pilot-experimental so that it can then deploy a large-scale support and training plan to a maximum of university teaching teams.</p>  <p> Review of CY Tech's Humanities and Design support  <br>On 9 December 2022, Téo Saal (on mission to the Transition Campus) and Anne-Christine Metz (Director of the Humanities and Design division of CY Tech) took stock of the first two years of support and training of the team during a presentation to the entire CYU educational community. What training sessions and thematic workshops have been set up? How have the teaching teams adapted the ecological and social issues? How was the Transition Campus able to accompany them to integrate these issues into their courses and pedagogy? Together, they went back on the support of the Campus de la Transition in the revision of the pedagogical model and the competence framework of the Humanities and Design cluster, in order to integrate more themes and skills responding to the challenges of transition. This long-term work has materialised by the joint design of a new teaching module for first year students of integrated prep . A novelty experienced for two consecutive years (2021-2023), over 1,200 students , having been trained on the challenges of ecological and social transition through a systemic approach. Anne-Christine Metz: "talking with the Transition Campus has allowed us to see how the subject we are teaching may be a gateway to the ecological and social transition. Whatever the subject you teach, the problems and the challenges of transition are present. The transition is everywhere."</p>  <p> Video presentation of the partnership  <br>To go further, discover the partnership in detail and watch the partnership presentation video. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJwdOHlKVzc <br>Let's CY #10 : Transition Campus</p>
