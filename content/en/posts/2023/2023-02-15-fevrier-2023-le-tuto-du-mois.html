    February 2023: Tuto of the Month The poncho that keeps warm
  summary: >-
    <p>Last month, we talked about "Operation Siberia" and our sobriety approach. Today we present you a flagship accessory of the Campus de la Transition to keep us warm in winter: the poncho!</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Following the great success of last winter's poncho use, we decided to repeat the experience. This year's ambition is to sew more than 20 ponchos and make them available to campuses and host groups. Workshops were again animated in early winter by Benedicte Vernier, seamstress (and Timothy's mother our gardener!). A big thank you to her for having designed the boss and tutorial presented here. Thanks also for agreeing to broadcast it widely! For these ponchos, we chose to use polar tissue. This material is very hot, easy to wash and does not defrost: a winning combo! It can therefore be cut and left as is, which greatly facilitates sewing since no hem is necessary. In response to many requests, we offer you this sewing tutorial so that you can also sew your own poncho! PS: If you replace the fleece with sponge tissue, you get a beautiful surfer poncho.</p>  <p> Découpage du poncho  <br>Step 1 For a poncho, a fabric of 1.5 m by 2.5 m is required. Note: The polar is scratched and shaved, slightly darker. The inverse is only scratched, that is a little lighter and slightly hairy. Note 2: Always cut the ponchos upside down. Fold the polar in 2 to obtain a width of 75cm - edge on edge / place on location. Then place the body pattern "on the fold" knowing that the seam margins are included.</p>  <p>   <br>Step 2 Then place the hood boss in the direction "Right Thread". Pin in several points. Cut all the paper, all around the body, neckline and hood.</p>  <p> Mounting of poncho  <br>Step 3 Locate the shape of the hood and pin the 2 pieces together (If the 2 pieces of the hood have not been detached after cutting, they are well on the spot). Sew the back of the hood at the elastic point or zig-zag point. Once the two parts of the hood are assembled, assemble the hood and the body of the poncho. The diagram below presents the poncho neckline.</p>  <p>   <br>Step 4 Pin the bottom of this seam in the middle of the back of the neckline (at position number 1 on the diagram) with the fabrics on the spot, as on the photos opposite.</p>  <p>   <br>Step 5 Pin one end of the hood at the bottom of the neckline at position number 2. Then pin between these two points, to properly distribute the fabric (from position number 1 to 2 to number 3). Do the same for the other side of the hood. Stitch at the elastic point or zig-zag, stopping 1 cm from the edge of position number 2 (this will then make it possible to make a right angle to mount the horizontal part). Pin the 2 small parts of the hood (between positions number 3 and 4) on the 10 cm horizontal neckline of the poncho, superimposing both parts of the hood in crossover.</p>  <p>   <br>Step 6 Stitch the entire length to complete the assembly. The final result of the installation is visible on the photo opposite.</p>
