    Meeting with T-Campus Mergieux actors, summer 2025

  body: >-
    <p>T- Campus in Mergieux in summer  <br>   <br>Sarah and Jean-Max, who are you ? S . : I maintained strong ties with the Campus after working there and living there in 2022. Now I design and animate trainings, including on systemic oppressions, techno-critical issues, community care, political ecology, etc. It is my heart to co-carry these subjects to the T-Campus. JM: I joined the Campus in 2023 after studying Neurosciences. Campus changed my relationship to others, to time, to money. I discovered how the sobriety experience could be transformative and virtuous. His motto "Training to transform" gave me hope and meaning. That's why I'm involved in the T-Campus swarm. Where's the T-Campus 2025? Why? JM: The T-Campus 2025 took place in Mergieux, a town of Najac, Aveyron. Here, a few years ago, the Bienvenue en Transition (Bienvenue en Transition) took up the crazy challenge of turning a abandoned Family Vacation Village into a place that is respectful of the living and which carries cultural and social initiatives. That the T-Campus can take place at the heart of this rural micro-territory, which carries a cultural dimension and another vision than conventional agriculture is a chance. Meetings around permacol projects or the social food security collective, artistic performances, hikes and folk balls have punctuated the training: it is essential for us to anchor the training in a territory and its realities. In a few words, what are the highlights? S.: This training embodies the Head-Corps-Coeur pedagogy of the Campus: it allows moments of intellectual stimulations and retreats that spread in the hearts through questioning, introspection and especially the link to others. Walks to the lake, naps in the heat, endless debates at meals, tears after a striking conference, laughter at the end of the day, are just as much part of the experience as the educational bricks of the program! JM: For me, the challenge is to accompany those who have had the courage to do this training. They will confront current environmental, social, philosophical, geopolitical findings, which can be emotionally engaging. We equip them so that as they progress they can function as a group, even outside of training. That e v o brought T- Campus? S.: The T-Campus, <br>arrived in my life in a moment of exhaustion, strengthened me a <br>conviction</p>  <p>Although the world is uncertain and complex, there are always some people who make the courageous choice to question their value systems and who sincerely seek to embody changes aligned with their beliefs. JM: Animating the T-Campus is something incredible, unpredictable, and transformative. The most gratifying thing is that the seeds planted during training lead to inspiring challenges and commitments, months and years later. What do you have? kept the participants? Florilège: Thomas training engineer, is delighted to have had the head-body-heart approach: "I realize that we can draw very strong conclusions from this and that we do not only need to understand with his head. » Violet , student in reconversion, found "a lot of inspiration: I understood that we can engage in many ways. » Ana , a student in the humanities, was "fed by benevolence, respect for nature and human relations". "I learned where I wanted to go, how to find a balance between my desire for activism (in a collective kitchen for migrants for example) and "normal" life where money is put at the centre. » What's next? Reunions with T-Campeuses and members of the organization will take place at the end of February. A good opportunity to reconnect and share new moments.</p>
