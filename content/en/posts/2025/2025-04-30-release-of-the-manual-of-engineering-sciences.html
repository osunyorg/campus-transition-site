    <p>  <br>Designed as a tool for reflection and action, the latest publication of the  XXI Engineer's Manual nd  century  (The Links that Released, 2025) aims to nourish this change of posture. Serment's proposal, like Hippocrates' proposal for doctors, is understood as a purpose rather than an injunction. Xavier Becquey, Pierre-jean Cottalorda, Christophe Goupil, Florent Haffner, Cécile Renouard and Myriam Saadé had the honour of coordinating this work with many colleagues. The intention of this new small manual is to offer tools to think differently about the training, practice and posture of engineers. Some important ideas :  <br> Transition is not only a question of technology: it is also social, political, cultural.  <br> Technical innovation only makes sense if it is linked to a fair and sustainable society project.  <br> Engineers have a key role to play - but they need to be empowered to think about it, to share it, to assume it.  <br> This book is an invitation to reopen together the big questions: Why? For who? With what consequences? It is intended for students, teachers, professionals and decision makers: all those who wish to participate in an engineering of the XXI nd  A century in keeping with the challenges of our time.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Buy the book <br>https://www.editionslinksquiliberent.fr/book-Manuel_de_l_ing%C3%A9nieur_du_XXIe_si%C3%A8cle-9791020923011-1-1-0-1.html</p>
