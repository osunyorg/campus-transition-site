    General Assembly 2025
  summary: >-
    <p>The General Assembly of the Transition Campus was held on weekends of 8 and 9 May 2025. The opportunity to vote on the moral report of the activities of 2024 and exchange on the perspectives of the association This year.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The weekend opened with the words of Cécile Renouard, our president, who wanted to put this AG from the angle of discernment, as a challenge for the Campus and our societies. She invited us to listen actively and to question : what is the vision shared between us, the one we want to nourish and how to link it with the institution ? Have "root and wings" as a base :  <br> The roots evoke something fundamental in the role of eco-location. They allow us to experience a more sober, more supportive life and evoke what is related to Common Life, hospitality, sensitivity, the desire to nourish research-action on the site by pursuing a philosophical deepening.  <br>  <br> The wings evoke those with whom we work, the cooperations, the partnerships, the efforts to spread more widely but also the discernment of the allocation of our human and financial resources for a sustainable model, the care of people and our collective. The wings invite us to be creative and creative.  <br> To embody the project, a big thank you to the active members of the association who met in Forges for the occasion ! In concrete terms, 2024 is :  <br> 1,620 people trained including 632 students.  <br> The partnership with CY that continues until 2027 through which 7200 students were affected.  <br> The continuation of our actions for a fair and supportive transition with the support of young people from working-class neighbourhoods, women in fragile situations, or beneficiaries of the RSA.  <br> Several research projects carried out such as the calculation of our carbon balance, the continuation of the Chalheureuse operation or the setting up of a multi-capital accounting project.  <br> We would like to thank the entire campus ecosystem, namely: our 83 active members, our board of directors as well as the operational teams made up of residents, employees, civic services, short and long term volunteers... And a big congratulations to our new office composed of:  <br>  <br> Cécile Renouard  who remains president of the association,  <br>  <br> Johanna Wagner  who becomes treasurer,  <br>  <br> Yann Collignon , which becomes secretary general.  <br>  <br> As well as Christian Koenig, who joins the CA almost several years of engagement. The Campus is all of you ! Thank you !</p>  <p>   <br>Download the moral report 2024</p>
