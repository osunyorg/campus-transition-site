    <p>As part of the 9th edition of the Open Gardens proposed by the Ile-de-France Region, the Campus de la Transition opened its doors in July, the opportunity to make the part beautiful to nature and culture. Back in images of the event.</p>

    <p>  <br>You have been more than 50 on the day to walk, chat, stroll, feel, touch and marvel at the garden that Timothy, Mathieu and Romane take care of every day by reconciling poetry, pedagogy and productivity. This time has also allowed you to attend an electro concert guaranteed "without electricity", to appreciate the game of the local theatre troupe of improvisation of Valencia-en-Brie, to reflect to our relations of strength thanks to the Show "Affabulations!" of the Compagnie Les Dramaticules and to taste homemade gourmets. The day continued between depth and lightness with the Herbal Contauses of the Federation of Rural Homes of 77 and the proposal of a folk ball around the world music, animated by our volunteer and resident, Alexis Seng. We are happy and grateful to have welcomed you, because the intention of the Campus is also to make the garden a place that gives, takes, but above all a place that lives. See you next year !</p>  <p> En images </p>  <p> Aller plus loin </p>
