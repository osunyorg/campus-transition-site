    A new, sober website for the Campus !

    <p>After long months of work, the new website of the Campus de la Transition is more sober, accessible and clear!</p>

    <p>Genesis  <br>Diluted information, very long display times, unsustainable site: here are some of the reasons why we wanted to undertake a redesign of our website. Through equipment manufacturing, data capture and hosting, digital technology represents many ethical and environmental issues. Sobriety and care being values dear to the Campus de la Transition, the construction of the website was an opportunity for us to do better on these aspects. After several weeks of research, our choice stopped on Noesya, a cooperative committed to high-quality digital, eco-designed, aesthetic, ethical and sustainable.</p>  <p> Sobriety and digital commons  <br>- Our site was designed with a low ecological impact - Noesya, using specific technologies, optimizes the energy cost, which in addition, drastically reduces the loading time of our pages. - Less Energizing Media - Images that represent a significant carbon cost are lighter and less present. We tried to offer you clearer content with less visuals, but better quality. - Our site is hosted "without data center" - Two Flowers, which hosts our website, uses less than ten old reconditioned computers to manage the data of its customers, including ours. Our accommodation is shared and promotes a free and friendly Internet.</p>  <p> Clarity and accessibility  <br>We have chosen to propose three distinct graphic environments in order to better value our main activities :  <br> red for training,  <br> green for the eco-location,  <br> Blue for research.  <br> Montserrat typography gives way to the Dosis, open-source and optimized for a fluid and accessible reading (considered today as one of the most readable typographies).</p>  <p>   <br>With common values such as conviviality and sobriety, we are pleased with this collaboration with Arnaud Levy and Noesya. We hope that the navigation on our site will be pleasant and will allow you to find your happiness.</p>
