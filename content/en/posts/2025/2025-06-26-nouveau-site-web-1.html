    <p>  <br>Between May and December 2024, the Campus de la Transition provided the USPN (Université Sorbonne Paris Nord) with a support course for teachers spread over 7 workshops. The aim of this action was to equip the faculty for the implementation of a TEDS module (ecological transition for sustainable development), as advocated by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research. <br>The themes of the workshop cycle addressed the pedagogies of the transition, the challenges of interdisciplinarity, and the relationship to politics. Two more practical sessions were devoted to co-construction of a prototype module via the method of pedagogical alignment. Very appreciated by the participants, with more than 60 people assiduous over the period, this accompanying journey allowed the emergence of a collective dynamic and a special emulation within the institution. A report published in the spring of 2025 details the lessons learned from this important work.</p>  <p> Read the report </p>
