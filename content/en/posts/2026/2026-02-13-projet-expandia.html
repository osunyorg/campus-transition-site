    <p>  <br>AMBITION From the beginning of 2025, all students must be trained in the Ecological Transition for Sustainable Development (TEDS) on a minimum volume of 30 hours. Training on TEDS issues in Higher Education, Research and Innovation (ESRI) is real and is already being initiated, notably through the creation of a number of resources. However, this training has yet to be expanded. The Court of Auditors therefore recommends developing incentives for every teacher to be convinced and to feel involved in this development. It also suggests better mobilization of existing educational resources. This diagnosis is shared on the ground by the consortium: resources are often used by teachers and teachers-researchers (E-EC) already engaged in TEDS, leaving behind a large part of the academic staff. The EXPANDIA project therefore aims to accelerate the dynamics at work in order to massify the integration of TEDS subjects into ESRI. The project thus provides higher education institutions with a comprehensive and personalised system of engagement and training for E-ECs to accelerate the effective transformation of teaching. The aim is to mobilise at least 6,000 participants on the Expandia route.</p>
