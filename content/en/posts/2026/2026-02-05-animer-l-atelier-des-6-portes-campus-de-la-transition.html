    Training to lead the workshop of the 6 doors - 11 & 12 March 2026

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>A training to be able to animate the workshop of the 6 Doors in autonomy among all public. The training will be moderated by Clémence and Clément, members of the Campus training team. Its objective: to allow you to be able to animate the workshop of the 6 Gates in autonomy among all audiences, and to join a network of animators and animators of the workshop! No prerequisites are required to complete this training. The workshop of the 6 Gates will be animated during the first day of training, so it is not necessary to have already attended it to register for the training. On the programme: discovery of the Transition Campus, participation in a workshop of the 6 Gates, deepening of the method of the 6 Gates via a survey of the Manual of the Great Transition, contributions on the teaching methods used and the tricks of animation, appropriation of the materials of the workshop and the economic model, etc. The training will be moderated by Clémence and Clément, both members of the Campus training team.  A journey to understand the systemic challenges of the transition and the tools to act on a daily basis. The Transition Campus has designed the Atelier des 6 Portes, an original training course that allows your teams to develop a global understanding of current ecological, social and economic issues, while integrating practical tools to take action. This workshop is structured around six key themes, which we call "doors" in reference to the approach designed by the collective FORTES (Manual of the Great Transition), each offering a reading grid to understand the challenges of transition from different angles, and provide concrete tools for action.  This approach allows us to go beyond mere awareness to take action: The training-action type of the workshop is based on a pedagogy integrating knowledge, know-how and know-how. Visual media and appropriation frames allow participants to walk through the 6 Gates and identify concrete ways of action. The 6 Gates Workshop is designed to be easily adapted to your organizational objectives. Whether you are a company, a community, an association or a public body, this workshop will allow you to develop a common vision of the challenges of transition and to co-build pragmatic solutions to address them at all levels. No Prerequisites required Self-financing: 300 € Financing by the employer or OPCO: 1000 € Self-financing:  This amount covers the educational aspects of the training, as well as the card game and posters of the 6 Gates that will be provided to you.
