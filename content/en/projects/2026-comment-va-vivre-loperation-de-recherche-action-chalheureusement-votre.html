    Operation of the action-research « Chalheureusement vôtre » live

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Teams from VoisinMalin, who came to visit the Campus, have heard of Operation Chalheureuse experienced on site (participatory method of reflection and organisation of winter thermal comfort allowing to limit energy consumption without degrading the comfort of life, via simple and fair means). They have made the connection with a big issue of summer and winter comfort in some neighborhoods. The Campus and VoisinMalin have therefore joined forces to bring together with the Fondation des Solidarités Urbaines the project "Heureuseuseusement Vôtres: Agir Ensemble contre la Précarité Énergétique", a research-action approach with residents of the City's Priority Districts, QPV.  In these neighbourhoods, the effects of climate change and energy insecurity combine - old collective housing, overheats in the summer, cold persistent in the winter, collective heating uncontrollable. In Évry-Courcouronnes (historical settlement town of VoisinMalin) and Montereau, more than 70% of residents report being too hot in summer and 62% too cold in winter, figures well above the national average. The Malin Neighbours, trained in listening and local mobilization, will be at the heart of the co-construction process, valuing the knowledge of use, experiences and local skills. The approach aims to strengthen the power of household action and to document the social benefits of energy sobriety, while creating a space for dialogue with donors. The project, which won €80k from the foundation of urban solidarity and €15k from the Qualitel endowment fund, will take place over two and a half years. It started at the end of January with an immersion phase: each party discovers the lifestyles of the other (at the Transition Campus and in the QPV of the project - Évry-Courcouronnes and the Surville neighbourhood in Montereau-• It will continue with a one-year experiment with the Malin Neighbours and will be followed by a dissemination of the teachings to the inhabitants. The project will be evaluated, inter alia, by Hélène L'huillier and Cécile Renouard, using indicators for measuring capacity and living well. The most curious will be able to dive into "The People of the Frillies", of  Olivier Jandot and   Renan Viguie , historians working on thermal comfort and in which Operation Siberia (previously named Operation Chalheureuse at Campus) is very quickly mentioned. Funny and rewarding!</p>
