    Transformations of Campuses

  body: >-
    <p>Executive summary  <br>Universities and large schools have recently been confronted with their contradictions and shortcomings in taking into account the ecological and social issues that cross Western society and have been led to question themselves deeply. How can we rethink curricula to integrate these issues in a systemic and holistic way? How can we reconcile openness to internationalism with the demand for carbon neutrality? How can we foster social diversity within the formations and put an end to the logics of domination that persist? Campuses are places for the formation of minds and values, places of life and work, and shape society in many ways through men and women who study, teach or work there. As such, they are privileged places to propel the Great Transition. Students, teachers, academic, administrative or other participants in campus life, this small handbook has been designed to help you transform your campus in all its dimensions (environmental, academic, social or territorial) by avoiding the trap of "small gestures" or greenwashing. It proposes to bring a method, examples of good practices and concrete initiatives to put your campus in transition!</p>  <p> The collection of "Small Manuals of the Great Transition"  <br>These manuals aim to deepen the stakes of the Great Transition in the teachings. Piloted by specialists in each field, these thirteen volumes cover the core themes and disciplines.</p>  <p>Discover the collection <br>https://www.campus-transition.org/fr/productions/publications/petit-manuel-de-la-grand-transition/</p>
