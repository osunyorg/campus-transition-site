    <p>Context: an issue of measuring relational quality in and around ecollies  <br>   <br>Created in 2008 by Cécile Renouard and Gaël Giraud, the Relationship Capacity Index (RCI) was thought to be a  alternative development indicator to conventional growth indicators  (such as GDP) and complementary to other development indicators that measure material poverty, such as the Multidimensional Poverty Indicator (MPI) created by OPHI and used by UNDP). It is based on a mixed approach combining qualitative and quantitative tools and on the theoretical framework of the approach to capabilities (Sen, 1993, 1999; Nussbaum, 2000), which invite human development to be assessed from people's access to freedoms of being and doing. The RCI thus seeks to measure the quality of the social bond within a group, territory or organisation. In its first version, the relational capacity indicator consisted of three dimensions:  <br> integration into socio-economic networks,  <br> social ties within the private sphere, and  <br> citizen engagement.  <br> Each of these dimensions consisted of several components or criteria – 14 in total – that correspond to capacity access conditions. It has been applied to different contexts: evaluation of projects carried out by multinational companies in Africa, Asia and Central America, measurement of the value of work, diagnosis of territory in local geographical context. <br> EZVAN, C., L'HUILLIER, H., RENOUARD, C.
