    Towards Another Form of Management

    <p>About  <br>A result of a collaboration that is unprecedented in its scale, this book demonstrates the plethora of initiatives underway to renew the teaching of management sciences in the face of the ecological and social crisis that we are going through. Through this manual, we want to provide teachers, researchers, students and professionals with resources to change the way management shapes society. The book first calls for management to emancipate itself from its status as an applied economic science so as not to be seen as an instrument of the financial performance of enterprises. It thus raises the need to study the diversity of organizational forms that populate society and embody an alternative to the dominant model. It also addresses the issue of governance and invites exploring different concepts of democracy applicable to organizations. It then proposes to identify, for each management sub-discipline, the main ideas, concepts and tools that can be used for the transition. He concluded on the importance of developing new reference frameworks for collective action, which required an internal division of management and greater openness to other disciplines. Bringing higher education back to the ecological and social challenges of our time: this is the ambition of the group of teachers-researchers FORTES who imagined and coordinated the volume of the collection of the Small Manuals of the Great Transition that you hold in your hands.</p>  <p> The collection of "Small Manuals of the Great Transition"  <br>These manuals aim to deepen the stakes of the Great Transition in the teachings. Piloted by specialists in each field, these thirteen volumes cover the core themes and disciplines.</p>  <p>Discover the collection <br>https://www.campus-transition.org/fr/productions/publications/petit-manuel-de-la-grand-transition/</p>
