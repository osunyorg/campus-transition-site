    <p>About  <br>It is time to rethink its values, foundations and practices. The medico-care and curative approaches no longer respond to the health, social and ecological challenges of the Anthropocene era. Now, the link between "human health" and "environmental health" needs to be restored. Social, territorial, environmental, political and psychological dynamics affect the health of populations. Making room for public health in the democratic debate, rethinking the organization of care, integrating digital technologies are all key issues opening up transition paths. These are all the issues raised by this Small Manual of the Great Transition, for teachers and students in the professions of public health, the social sector... and beyond. Through an interdisciplinary approach to "health-environment," it is about crossing six doors, all of which are avenues for questioning, in order to rethink health and reshape our health system.</p>  <p> The collection of "Small Manuals of the Great Transition"  <br>These manuals aim to deepen the stakes of the Great Transition in the teachings. Piloted by specialists in each field, these thirteen volumes cover the core themes and disciplines.</p>  <p>Discover the collection <br>https://www.campus-transition.org/fr/productions/publications/petit-manuel-de-la-grand-transition/</p>
