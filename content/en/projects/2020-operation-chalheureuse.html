    <p>About  <br>Operation Siberia, newly renamed Operation Chalheureuse, has existed at the Campus since 2020 in the face of the challenge of heating such a building.  In parallel with many renovations, including insulation, work on thermal sobriety has been carried out around three axes:  <br> Heat bodies  <br> Heat spaces  <br> Communicate.  <br> This operation wants to emphasize the possibility of heating in a more sober way (spatialisation, temperature below the standards of our society) while maintaining a certain comfort that respects the sensitivities of each.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Illustration by Clémence Pichon, Campus Training Officer</p>  <p>   <br>In early winter, the sixth edition of Operation Siberia/Chalheureuse was launched with the aim of taking care of all Campus residents this year, taking into account the multiplicity of profiles received. For this purpose a working group of 6 people has been reconstituted to organize thermal sobriety at the Campus. From Siberia to Chalheureuse, the name of this operation was considered. The winter conditions at Campus have changed well (including the renovation of the windows during spring 20204) and are no longer as harsh as in previous years. They are now far removed from the hostile imagination sent back by Siberia. In order to evoke a more desirable imagination, Operation Chalheureuse would like to act by gentleness, emphasizing the possible and necessary association between sobriety and comfort, even in the heart of winter. Feedback questionnaires have been circulated several times to take into account the sensitivity of each person, to allow operational adjustments for adjusted heat and to deepen the link between friendliness and sobriety. In addition, the working group organized several times, addressed to different profiles:  <br> For the BCTs, an exchange evening was held to discuss their cold feelings at Campus.  <br> For employees, a time with the SSC was organised to frame this operation.  <br> For the host groups, the WG worked on a training module on Operation Chalheureuse to ensure that each host understands the thermal sobriety issues we face at the Campus (and more broadly) and feels included in this experiment. The purpose of this training module would be to be presented to each group hosted in winter.  <br> </p>  <p> Go further </p>
