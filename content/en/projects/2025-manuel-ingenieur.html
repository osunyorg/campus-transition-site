    Engineer Manual of the XXI century

  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>The role of engineers in the ecological and social transition has never been more crucial. This role deserves much more thought than it is today for action geared towards the common good. By crossing the eyes of philosophers, economists, scientists and leaders, this book questions the limits of technical innovation, stressing the need to integrate the values of sobriety and collective responsibility into technological action. At the heart of this reflection, thematic doors are proposed to guide engineers towards a systemic and interdisciplinary vision: from environmental diagnostics to the reinvention of ethics, to inspiring cultural narratives and reconnection to oneself and nature. In the face of pressing challenges, the manual advocates engineering that is no longer solely at the service of technical or financial performance but of the common good. To increase the individual and collective responsibility of engineers, but also their accountability, this book is accompanied by an "Oath of the Engineer" inspired by the "Oath of Hippocrates".</p>  <p> The collection of "Small Manuals of the Great Transition"  <br>These manuals aim to deepen the stakes of the Great Transition in the teachings. Piloted by specialists in each field, these thirteen volumes cover the core themes and disciplines.</p>  <p>Discover the collection <br>https://www.campus-transition.org/fr/productions/publications/petit-manuel-de-la-grand-transition/</p>
