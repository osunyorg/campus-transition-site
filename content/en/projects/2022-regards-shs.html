    Undisciplined Perspectives from the Social Sciences and Humanities

  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>What can the Human and Social Sciences (SHS) look at on issues related to the Great Transition? What types of analysis do these sciences provide to understand the present situation and the events that led to it? It is to the treatment of these issues that this book focuses on, following the Manual of the Great Transition. The aim here is to extend, discuss and supplement the discussion in this manual, by freely combining the views of different SHS disciplines. Geography, history, sociology, political science and philosophy are thus invited to contribute to a "undisciplined" vision of what this process of Great Transition can be. The importance from the point of view of the SHS in the understanding and commitment of a Great Transition lies both in their ability to describe and understand past and present situations, to draw possible directions towards which to move and to provide levers of action in order to be able to move towards possible desirable ones.</p>  <p> The collection of "Small Manuals of the Great Transition"  <br>These manuals aim to deepen the stakes of the Great Transition in the teachings. Piloted by specialists in each field, these thirteen volumes cover the core themes and disciplines.</p>  <p>Discover the collection <br>https://www.campus-transition.org/fr/productions/publications/petit-manuel-de-la-grand-transition/</p>
