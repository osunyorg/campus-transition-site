  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>Ecology is a young science that was built as a new scientific discipline in the late 19th century, but draws its origins from an accumulation of knowledge dating back centuries. Its raison d'être is the study of the living non-human world and its many complex and dynamic interactions. This science, which is constantly evolving, offers us many lessons that it is necessary to mobilize to understand and act in an uncertain world. It is a great source of inspiration to deal with the deep ecological and social crises that are shaking our societies. That is why we mobilize both theory and practice, reflection and action, science and conscience. In this book, we will try to navigate through the diversity of debates, concepts and scientific evolutions of ecology. We invite readers to plunge into the heart of a transformative and transformational science, and to walk through the meandering of an "incarnate" ecology that makes us aware of our existential roots in a unique habitat: the Earth Let yourself be guided in this extraordinary educational and reflexive adventure!</p>  <p> The collection of "Small Manuals of the Great Transition"  <br>These manuals aim to deepen the stakes of the Great Transition in the teachings. Piloted by specialists in each field, these thirteen volumes cover the core themes and disciplines.</p>  <p>Discover the collection <br>https://www.campus-transition.org/fr/productions/publications/petit-manuel-de-la-grand-transition/</p>
