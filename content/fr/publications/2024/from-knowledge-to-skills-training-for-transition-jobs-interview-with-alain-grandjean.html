  Alain Grandjean is an economist and author specializing on green finance. He is also cofounder and partner of Carbone 4, a consultancy firm focusing on energy transition and adaptation to climate change. The interview first revolves around the academic content Alain Grandjean considers as the bare necessities to be taught in higher education, no matter the curriculum. This should take the form of a basic synthetic training which takes into account the major environmental issues without too much technicality as well as lessons in accounting and economics, which he considers essential. The interview also looks more specifically at engineering and business schools. Then Alain Grandjean shares his views on the effectiveness of different ways to engage for the transition -like radical individual lifestyle transformations and civil disobiedience. He also evokes the roles that trade unions as well as NGOS can play and he talks about collapsology.
